# Abstract

This whitepaper introduces a decentralized autonomous club (DAC) framework designed to enable communities to create, purchase, and manage clubs. The main token, Starzz, serves as the leading currency for all DACs in the ecosystem. The framework aims to solve the problem of low community participation and interaction in commercial clubs, along with the lack of control and voice that members typically have.

The framework allows for the creation of exclusive communities and clubs, as well as the purchase of existing ones. It offers a set of pre-made templates that allow for the easy creation of a club with the desired governance structure in just a few minutes. The level of democracy can be adjusted to meet the needs of the community. The framework also enables direct and controlled contact between stars and their communities, enabling active participation and influence through democratic processes on the club's operational activities.

The framework's token economy allows clubs to capitalize or monetize, with a wide range of distribution options available. The governance structure of the DACs can be tailored to the needs and preferences of each community, with a variety of options available, such as basic democracy, council models, and reputation-based models.

The DAC framework uses smart contracts for various functions such as voting, escrow, governance, and transactions. The smart contracts enable live voting, manage club acquisition funds, control token economics, and enable access and identity management.

The risks associated with the framework include regulatory and governance risks, which can be minimized through standardized features and support from the team and external partners.

In conclusion, the DAC framework enables communities to create, purchase, and manage clubs while providing a higher level of community participation, interaction, and control. The framework is designed to be flexible and adaptable, providing communities with the ability to customize their club's governance structure and token economy to meet their specific needs and preferences.
