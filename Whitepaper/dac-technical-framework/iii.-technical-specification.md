# III. Technical Specification

The DAC framework is based on blockchain technology and smart contracts, which enable the creation of decentralized and autonomous organizations. In order to set up a DAC, there are several technical requirements that must be met.

&#x20;

## **Architecture**

The DAC architecture is based on the Ethereum blockchain, which is a decentralized platform that allows the creation of smart contracts. The Ethereum blockchain is a distributed ledger that is secured through a consensus algorithm, where nodes in the network work together to validate transactions and maintain the integrity of the blockchain. The Ethereum blockchain provides a secure and transparent way to store and execute code without the need for a centralized intermediary.

The DAC architecture can be divided into several layers:

1. Infrastructure Layer The infrastructure layer includes the hardware and software components that are necessary to run the DAC. This includes the nodes that run the Ethereum blockchain and the servers that host the smart contracts and user interfaces. The infrastructure layer must be optimized to ensure the performance and reliability of the DAC.
2. Smart Contract Layer The smart contract layer is where the rules and governance of the DAC are defined. Smart contracts are self-executing contracts that contain the rules and regulations that govern the behavior of the DAC. The smart contracts used in the DAC framework define the governance structure, decision-making processes, and token economics of the organization. They also contain the rules for the creation and management of tokens, which are used as a means of exchange and governance within the DAC.
3. User Interface Layer The user interface layer provides a way for users to interact with the DAC. This can be a web application, mobile application, or any other type of user interface. The user interface layer must be designed to be intuitive and easy to use, while also providing access to all the features and functionality of the DAC.
4. Network Layer The network layer provides the connectivity between the different components of the DAC. This includes the communication between nodes in the Ethereum blockchain network, as well as the communication between the user interface and the smart contracts. The network layer must be optimized to ensure low latency and high throughput, while also maintaining the security and integrity of the DAC.
5. Data Layer The data layer is where user data and other important data is stored. This includes data about transactions, user profiles, and other information that is necessary for the operation of the DAC. The data layer must be designed to be secure and scalable, while also providing fast access to data when it is needed.

## **Smart Contracts**

Smart contracts are the building blocks of the DAC framework. They are self-executing contracts that contain the rules and regulations that govern the behavior of the organization. Smart contracts are written in Solidity, which is a programming language that is specifically designed for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

The smart contracts used in the DAC framework define the governance structure, decision-making processes, and token economics of the organization. They also contain the rules for the creation and management of tokens, which are used as a means of exchange and governance within the DAC.

One of the key advantages of using smart contracts in the DAC framework is that they are designed to be reusable. This means that once a smart contract has been created for one DAC, it can easily be deployed for a new DAC with only minor modifications. This makes the process of creating and deploying new DACs much faster and more efficient.

Furthermore, the DAC framework is EVM-compatible, which means that the smart contracts used in the framework can be ported to other EVM-compatible blockchains. This allows for greater flexibility in choosing which blockchain to use for a particular DAC.

In addition to being reusable and compatible with other blockchains, the DAC framework is also designed to make the process of creating and deploying new DACs as easy as possible. The framework will include drag-and-drop tools that enable users to easily create and deploy new DACs without needing extensive technical knowledge.

In summary, the smart contracts used in the DAC framework are self-executing contracts that define the governance structure, decision-making processes, and token economics of the organization. They are designed to be reusable, making the process of creating and deploying new DACs faster and more efficient. The framework is also EVM-compatible, allowing for greater flexibility in choosing which blockchain to use, and includes drag-and-drop tools to make the process of creating and deploying new DACs as easy as possible.&#x20;

## **Technical Requirements**

In order to set up a DAC, the following technical requirements must be met:&#x20;

* Ethereum Blockchain: The DAC framework is built on the Ethereum blockchain, which means that a node must be set up to interact with the blockchain.
* Smart Contracts: Smart contracts must be developed and deployed on the Ethereum blockchain to define the rules and governance of the DAC.
* Token Standard: The ERC20 token standard is used for the creation and management of tokens within the DAC. This standard defines a set of rules for the creation, transfer, and management of tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.
* User Interface: A user interface must be developed to allow users to interact with the DAC. This can be a web application, mobile application, or any other type of user interface.
* Network and Server Configuration: The network and server configuration must be optimized to ensure the performance and reliability of the DAC. This includes setting up nodes, servers, and other infrastructure to ensure the smooth operation of the DAC.

## **Security and Integrity**

Security and integrity are critical factors for the success of a decentralized autonomous club (DAC). In a DAC, the use of smart contracts and data storage on a decentralized blockchain requires a comprehensive security strategy that covers all aspects of the system. A "defense in depth" strategy, which involves implementing multiple layers of security controls, can provide a robust security framework for DACs.

In addition, collaborating with trusted 3rd-party partners such as cybersecurity auditors and legal experts can further enhance the security and compliance of the DAC platform.

This section of the white paper provides a detailed overview of the security measures that can be implemented within a DAC framework to ensure the security and integrity of the platform. We will also discuss how DACs can collaborate with other protocols and ensure that they comply with legal and regulatory requirements. By following these guidelines, DACs can create a trustworthy and secure platform that can be relied upon by its members and stakeholders.

&#x20;

### Smart Contract Code Security

Smart contract code is the backbone of the DAC framework, and its security must be ensured to prevent malicious actors from exploiting vulnerabilities and compromising the platform's integrity. The following measures can be implemented to enhance smart contract code security:

* Secure coding practices: Developers should follow secure coding practices, such as input validation, error handling, and code testing, to prevent common coding errors and vulnerabilities.
* Code audits: Regular code audits can help identify vulnerabilities and bugs in the smart contract code and ensure that the code adheres to best practices and coding standards.
* Formal verification: Formal verification techniques can be used to mathematically prove the correctness of the smart contract code, eliminating the risk of runtime errors.

### Platform Integrity&#x20;

The integrity of the DAC platform and its data must be maintained to prevent unauthorized access, tampering, or deletion of critical data. The following measures can be implemented to ensure platform integrity:

* Access controls: Access controls can be used to restrict access to sensitive data and functions, ensuring that only authorized users can access and modify critical system components.
* Data encryption: Data encryption can be used to protect sensitive data stored in the DAC platform, making it unreadable and unusable to unauthorized parties.
* Multi-signature wallets: Multi-signature wallets can be used to prevent unauthorized access to the DAC's funds and require multiple parties to sign off on transactions before they can be executed.
* Secure communication protocols: Secure communication protocols can be used to ensure that data exchanged between different components of the DAC framework is encrypted and protected from eavesdropping and tampering.

### User Roles and Access Controls&#x20;

Defining user roles and access controls is critical to preventing unauthorized access and manipulation of the DAC platform. The following measures can be implemented to ensure user roles and access controls are well defined and enforced:

* Role-based access controls: Role-based access controls can be used to assign specific roles to users and restrict access to specific functions based on their assigned roles.
* Two-factor authentication: Two-factor authentication can be used to add an extra layer of security to user accounts and ensure that only authorized users can access the DAC platform.
* User training and awareness: Users should be trained and made aware of security best practices and potential security threats to help prevent social engineering attacks or other security breaches.

### Detection and Response&#x20;

Detecting and responding to security incidents is critical to minimize damage and prevent further attacks. The following measures can be implemented to detect and respond to security incidents:

* Security monitoring: Security monitoring tools can be used to detect anomalous behavior, such as unauthorized access attempts, data exfiltration, or system tampering.
* Incident response plans: Incident response plans can be developed to guide the response to security incidents and ensure that all stakeholders are notified, and the incident is contained and resolved promptly. These plans should include clear procedures for incident reporting, investigation, containment, and resolution, as well as communication protocols for notifying all affected parties, such as users, administrators, and regulators.

### Continuous Improvement&#x20;

Continuous improvement is key to maintaining the security and integrity of the DAC framework. The following measures can be implemented to ensure continuous improvement:

* Security testing: Regular security testing can help identify vulnerabilities and potential security gaps in the DAC framework, allowing for timely remediation.
* Security awareness training: Ongoing security awareness training can help ensure that all stakeholders are aware of security best practices and the latest security threats.
* Learning from others: Learning from the experiences and best practices of other blockchain projects can help improve the security and integrity of the DAC framework.

Team-led clubs can also engage third-party cyber security audit partners to review and test the DAC framework for security vulnerabilities. Additionally, third-party legal advisors can ensure that the DAC framework complies with relevant regulations and laws.

The defense in depth strategy outlined above provides a comprehensive approach to ensuring the security and integrity of the DAC framework. By implementing a range of security measures that cover all aspects of the system, DACs can ensure that their platforms are secure, trustworthy, and resilient to cyber threats.

## **Token Economics**

Tokens play a crucial role in the DAC framework. They are used as a means of exchange and governance within the DAC. The token economics of the DAC are defined by the smart contracts, which determine the creation, distribution, and management of tokens.

## **User Data and Rights Management**

The DAC must have a system in place for the management of user data and rights. This includes implementing measures such as user authentication and authorization, data encryption, and data access controls to ensure the privacy and security of user data.&#x20;

## **Development Platforms and Programming Languages**

The DAC framework is built on the Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts, which means that Solidity is the primary programming language used for development. Other development platforms and programming languages, such as Truffle and Remix, can also be used to develop and deploy smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.&#x20;

## **Protocols and Standards**

The DAC framework is built on open standards and protocols, which ensures interoperability between different DACs. The ERC20 token standard is used for the creation and management of tokens within the DAC, while the Ethereum blockchain provides a secure and transparent platform for the execution of smart contracts. Other standards and protocols, such as IPFS and Whisper, can also be used to enable decentralized file storage and messaging within the DAC.

&#x20;

In summary, the DAC framework is built on the Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts, which enable the creation of decentralized and autonomous organizations. Setting up a DAC requires meeting technical requirements, such as setting up a node to interact with the Ethereum blockchain, developing and deploying smart contracts to define the rules and governance of the DAC, implementing a user interface for users to interact with the DAC, optimizing network and server configurations, and ensuring security and integrity measures to prevent attacks or hacks. Tokens play a critical role in the DAC framework and are defined by the smart contracts, which determine the creation, distribution, and management of tokens. The DAC must also have a system in place for the management of user data and rights. Solidity is the primary programming language used for development, and open standards and protocols ensure interoperability between different DACs.
