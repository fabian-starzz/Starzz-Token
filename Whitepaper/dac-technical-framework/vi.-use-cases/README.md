# VI. Use Cases

The Use Cases section of the white paper serves as a crucial demonstration of the DAC framework's flexibility and adaptability. It showcases the multitude of ways in which the framework can be tailored to meet the specific needs of various organizations and communities. In this section, we will present 20 diverse use cases that exemplify the potential of the DAC framework in a range of industries and domains, including but not limited to finance, entertainment, sports, and social impact. These use cases will illustrate how the DAC framework can enable decentralized decision-making, token economics, and governance structures that empower users and stakeholders, while promoting transparency, accountability, and security



Only a few ideas could be:

* Streamer DAC \
  A gaming streamer can use a DAC to create a platform for decentralized decision-making, where members can vote on which games to play, what equipment to use, and how to allocate funds towards marketing and content creation.
* The Talent Agency DAC\
  A DAC that functions as a talent agency for up-and-coming actors, models, and performers. Members can vote on which clients to sign and how to allocate funds towards their promotion and development.
* Environmental DAC\
  An Environmental uses a quadratic voting system to determine which environmental projects to fund, giving more weight to votes from members who are most affected by the issues.
* Music Fan Club DAC\
  A fan club for a popular musician can use the DAC framework to create a decentralized platform for fan engagement, where they can vote on concert locations, merchandise designs, and even song setlists.
* The Gamer's Guild\
  A DAC where video game streamers and content creators can come together to collaborate and share resources. Members can vote on which games to focus on and how to allocate funds towards equipment upgrades and marketing.
* A charity organization may use a representative model, where representatives are elected based on their experience and expertise in the field.
* A tech startup may use a liquid democracy model, where token holders can delegate their voting power to developers or other team members with the necessary expertise.
* A decentralized social media platform may use a DAD model, where all token holders have equal voting power and decisions are made through a consensus mechanism.
* A Crypto Investment Club implements majority voting to determine which assets to invest in.
