# IV. Token Economy

The token economy in the DAC framework plays a crucial role in enabling decentralized decision-making and incentivizing participation from members. The tokens are used as a means of exchange and governance within the DAC, allowing members to have a say in the decision-making processes and to be rewarded for their contributions.

The distribution model for tokens in the DAC framework can vary depending on the goals of the organization. There are several models that can be used, including fixed supply, bonding curve, and token sale.

For example, a DAC[^1] that aims to incentivize long-term participation from members may choose to use a fixed supply model, where the total supply of tokens is fixed and new tokens are not created. This encourages members to hold onto their tokens and participate in decision-making processes, as the value of the tokens may increase over time.

On the other hand, a DAC that aims to raise funds for a specific project may choose to use a token sale model, where tokens are sold to investors in exchange for cryptocurrency or fiat currency. This allows the DAC to raise funds quickly and efficiently, but it may also lead to a high concentration of tokens in the hands of a few investors.

Part 2 of the white paper will provide a detailed tokenomic example that showcases the flexibility and adaptability of the DAC framework. The choice of distribution model ultimately depends on the organization's specific goals and values. With the DAC framework, organizations can design and implement a token economy that aligns with their objectives.

## Details on the token distribution model

There are various token distribution models that can be used within the DAC framework. A few interesting examples are:

* Initial Coin Offering (ICO)
* Security Token Offering (STO)
* Airdrop
* Mining
* Masternodes
* Pre-sale
* Public sale
* Private sale
* Seed round
* Angel round
* Venture capital
* Decentralized Autonomous Initial Coin Offering (DAICO)
* Token Burn
* Community rewards
* Staking rewards
* Buyback and burn
* Liquidity provision rewards
* Yield farming
* Lockdrop
* Fair launch
