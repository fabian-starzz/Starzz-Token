# DAC Technical Framework

The DAC Technical Framework is a comprehensive guide that provides the knowledge needed for building decentralized autonomous communities, which are powered by smart contracts and governed by their members. In this framework, the Starzz token (STRZ) serves as the native currency for all DACs and provides a standard for value exchange across the network. Each DAC has its own Starzz pair, which represents the trading pair for that DAC's token within the larger ecosystem. The Starzz token plays a crucial role in the DAC ecosystem, as it facilitates the exchange of value and enables members to participate in governance and economic activities.

To further enhance the economic potential of the DAC ecosystem, an NFT marketplace can be integrated into the framework. This marketplace provides a platform for buying, selling, and trading NFTs issued by the different DACs, including artwork, collectibles, and other unique digital assets. By combining the NFT marketplace with the DAC framework, we create a more comprehensive ecosystem where members can participate in both governance and economic activities, further strengthening the overall value proposition of the DAC ecosystem.





In the following sections, we will explore the technical specifications, token economy, governance structure, and use cases for the DAC framework and wont cover the Starzz (STRZ) token.
